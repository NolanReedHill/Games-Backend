# Nolan's Games App
## Overview
This is the back end repository for my online games page, currently live at [https://nolans-games.netlify.app/](https://nolans-games.netlify.app/).
This backend is built using Express.js, alongside Google Firestore to store leaderboards, and Stream Chat API to handle accounts and online connectivity. 
You can find the front end repository [here](https://github.com/NolanReedHill/Games-Backend).
